# Re(me)mber
Repository used during the development of an application related to my engineering thesis.

**Re(me)mber** is being developed for Android devices and the web platform. It is a tool for people of all ages to easily collect memories using the latest technology.

The implementation of the application is based on Flutter technology, which allows the creation of multiplatform applications using a single code base. The Firebase platform is responsible for storing memories and managing users.

**For more information about the application please follow the link below. It opens a PDF file containing my engineering thesis (in Polish).**
